Initial hosting of the API

Since the API was designed with the assumption that the end user only ever wanted the full object back and does not want to allow the end user to add/edit or delete boardgames directly those operations were not encoded. 

## TODO: add an update operation which refreshes the information scraped from boardgame arena. This function when implemented should not be run often to respect the terms of conditions of the boardgamegeek API.
